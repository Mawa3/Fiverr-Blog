            <p>The past year was one that no small business could have prepared for as the COVID-19 pandemic forced
                worldwide stay-at-home orders and subsequent shutdowns. On top of their usual expectations to adapt to
                changing customer needs, many had to figure out how to digitally transform in order to survive. Now,
                over one year into the pandemic, many are still operating online or with limited in-person capacity.
            </p>
            <p>Despite this, we’ve also seen strength and resilience in small businesses and entrepreneurs. Businesses
                are building back and finding new ways to reach their customers, people are still creating, and most
                importantly, recovery is in sight.</p>
